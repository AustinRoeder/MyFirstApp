            Born and raised in Georgia, I began my adventures in programming after entering high school. Once the 10th Grade semester-long beginners course was over, I continued learning the C# language by finding tutorials online and teaching myself what I thought I needed to know. Going into college I had picked up multiple new programming styles including Java and HTML5. After finding programming boot camps that interested me, I began teaching myself the necessary languages to get into the programs, including JavaScript and Ruby.  Being accepted into Coder Foundry, I began going over HTML and CSS, as well as focusing less on Ruby and more on JavaScript.
